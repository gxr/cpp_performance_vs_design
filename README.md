# Performance versus Design in C++ (a 1 day tutorial)

## Open-Source Teaching 

The source code (comprising slides and examples) contained in this repository are my first attempt to open up my teaching. The workshop that this material was aimed at was split in 2 parts (half a day each). More details of the workshop can be found here: <https://indico.desy.de/conferenceDisplay.py?ovw=True&confId=9932> 

Everyone is encouraged to fork, debug, correct and redistribute this tutorial under the given license or write bug reports on the github issue page. Comments or questions on technical or teaching issues are very welcome both from a students and instructors point of view.

## Structure

The example code and slides is targeted to compile and run under Linux. All folders contain a README.md like this one and a makefile to build the source code. Where possible, the purpose of code from a teaching point of view is given.
