# Performant Design in C++ (part 2/2)

## Goal

The following subdirectories contain the code for the live coding I did for the second half of the tutorial. The main motivation of this is to introduce participants to template programming in C++ and show some programming techniques that I have found to be helpful in terms of speed and insightful in terms the inner workings of C++. Only the introduction to template programming I thought to be mandatory, the remaining topics *Design-by-policy*, *CRTP*, *Expression Templates* and *Template Meta-Programming* will be touched upon the time left and the expertise/motivation of the participants.

## Disclaimer

The realm of performant design (not only in C++) also has many facets and offers a wide variety of pitfalls. Hence, the selection of topics I chose is highly personaly and I would never suggest to use them blindly.
