# Performance versus Design in C++ (part 1/2)

## Goal

The following subdirectories contain the slides as well as code snippets for examples and exercises. The main motivation of this talk is to review what performance might mean from a C++ programmers point of view and what implications this might have.

## Disclaimer

Due to the fact, that not only the term performance is ambiguous and extremeley multifaceted, I chose to pick topics that were essential to me in the past and that I thought to be important to share. This choice was heavily influenced by the software domain (data analysis in particle physics, image analysis in biology) most of current and prior work was/is dedicated to.
